# Part 1: Scraping Titles and Preview Text from Mars News
In this part of the project, we utilized automated browsing with Splinter to visit the Mars news website and then extracted the HTML code using Beautiful Soup. We identified the relevant elements on the webpage and scraped the titles and preview text of the news articles. The scraped information was stored in Python data structures, specifically a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contained the title and preview of a news article.

# Requirements Met:
Automated browsing and HTML extraction were successfully implemented using Splinter and Beautiful Soup. (10 points)
Titles and preview text of news articles were scraped and extracted. (20 points)
Scraped information was stored in a list of dictionaries as specified. (10 points)

# Part 2: Scraping and Analyzing Mars Weather Data
For this part, we used automated browsing to visit the Mars temperature data site and scraped the data using Beautiful Soup. The data was assembled into a Pandas DataFrame, where each column represented different attributes such as the date, sol, minimum temperature, and atmospheric pressure. We analyzed the dataset to answer various questions regarding Martian weather, such as the number of months on Mars, the coldest and warmest months, and the atmospheric pressure variations. Additionally, we exported the DataFrame into a CSV file for further analysis.

# Requirements Met:
HTML table extraction into a Pandas DataFrame was successfully implemented using Beautiful Soup. (15 points)
The dataset was analyzed to answer specific questions regarding Martian weather. (10 points)
Data visualizations were created to support the answers to the questions. (30 points)
The DataFrame was exported to a CSV file as requested. (5 points)

# Summary
Overall, both parts of the project involved effectively scraping data from relevant sources and analyzing it to gain insights into Martian news and weather patterns. The use of automated browsing, Beautiful Soup, and Pandas facilitated the extraction and manipulation of data, allowing us to meet the project requirements effectively.
